# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow. 
I'm a senior project manager for Compiler, a civic tech consulting firm. 
I created this repo to gain fluency with GitHub and better support the Compiler dev team, but I'm not a developer myself. 
I love my fiance David, my cat Baran, the majestic power of cinema, Swedish sour gummy candy, and Dungeons and Dragons. 
If you ever want to chat project management for social good, I'm 1000% down.
